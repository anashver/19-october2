            <h4><b>Dogs</b></h4>
            <p> The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris [5]) is a domesticated of the wolf which is 
                characterized by an upturning tail.<b>The dog is derived from an ancient,</b>extinct wolf,[6][7] <br> the modern wolf
                is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8]by hunter-gatherers 
                over 15,000 years ago,[7]before the development of agriculture <br><br>
                <b>Due to their long association with humans,</b> dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and 
                gained the ability o thrive on a starch-rich diet that would beinadequate for other canids.[11]Over the <br>millennia, dogs 
                became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study
